CRUD-app

This project is a simple and efficient CRUD application using ReactJS that allows users to create, read, update, and delete records through an intuitive interface. The app displays a list of items on the HomePage, where users can add new records, view existing ones, delete entries, or navigate to a dedicated EditPage to update selected data.

The project demonstrates essential React concepts such as component-based structure, state management using useState, routing with React Router, form handling, and dynamic navigation. It is a practical example of building interactive UIs, managing data flow across components, and implementing smooth user interactions within a single-page application.
